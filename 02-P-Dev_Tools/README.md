#This is the *non-recursive* algorithm of determinant calculation.
##Method converts matrix to top triangle form and calculate determinant as a multiplication of main diagonal elements.

##How to build and run:
1. Make the *git clone* from this repo to some directory.
1. Change terminal directory by *cd* command.
1. To build project run *make* terminal command.
1. Then run builded executable file determ_calc and add matrix in one line like this:<br>
    **./determ_calc 4 2 5 99 74 0 7 32 15**
1. Then you will see something like this:  <br>
    **Matrix dimension is 3** <br>
    **Determinant of this matrix equals 14720.000000** 
1. Congratulation!
